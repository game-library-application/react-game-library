# GameHub

## Description

Welcome to **GameHub**, your new favorite game library!

For our second project, we have created a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and a back-end REST API. 

The application is able to perform all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on that API.

## Instructions

To be able to run this on your computer, you have to run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```
To run and test the application, the command is:

```
npm run dev
```

## Demo

Go ahead and give it a try!
